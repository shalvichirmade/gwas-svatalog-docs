Welcome to GWAS SVatalog's documentation!
=========================================

**GWAS SVatalog** is a web-based browsing and visualization tool that fascilitates fine-mapping of GWAS loci with structural variations (SVs). It is part of the |software_link| suite of software tools specializing in the analysis of GWAS fine-mapping. The SVatalog allows the user to visualize linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SVs and GWAS-associated SNPs. The software is availible |location_link|.

   Database constructed from predominantly European population of 101 individauls with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The alleles affected by CF aside, the remainder of the genome is comparable to a healthy population of European descent (*link to publication TBD*). Genomic location is referenced against GRCh38.
